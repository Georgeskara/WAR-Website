match for our team's robot to ensure maximum success during alliance selections with other teams. Without the scout team, strong alliances with other teams cannot be created, lowering the
team's chances of reaching far in the FIRST competitions.</h4><img src="Scout_Team.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float:right;"/>
